Hello World Indeed!

What a rush!  I am writing some "code," and have never been more excited to write despite doing it for a living.

A bit about me:  I am an attorney looking to learn more about coding, blockchain and the like.  I believe that blockchain is a revolutionary way to transmit and track data and actions, and that smart contracts can and will help increase the efficiency of many of our legacy systems that have been slow to adopt, including the legal and judicial systems.  My view is that lawyers that understand and can interpret the issues surrounding these new paradigms will be ahead of the curve.  However, I don't think the need for lawyers will ever dissapear entirely.
